What is a README file?
The README file extension indicates to your device which app can open the file. However, different programs may use
the README file type for different types of data.

While we do not yet describe the README file format and its common uses, we do know which programs are known 
to open these files, as we receive dozens of suggestions 
from users like yourself every day about specific file types and which programs they use to open them.

We are continually working on adding more file type descriptions to the site, so if you have information 
about README files that you think will help others, please use the Update Info link below to submit it to us - we'd love to hear from you!
